# Python-Projects Password Generator

A program that can generate a calculator.
    
    Elements used:
        -Functions with outputs
        -Docstrings

The clear screen is made by multiples "new lines" and the art is form the exercise. I added the option to stop the calculator that is not present on the original exercise.
